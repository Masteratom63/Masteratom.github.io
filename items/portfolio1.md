## Portfolio

In this term we designed many things in our different UX courses. </br>
Some of them are listed below: </br>

### Subject 1
For UX 211 - Graphic Design Studio we learned how to use Adobe Illustrator.</br>
We created many different basic designs using it. But they are too basic to display so I will display other class stuff.

### Subject 2
For UX 201 - Maker Lab 1 we made a paper airplane making guide, and I made it in Illustrator, I have a few images that might help you visualize mu paper airplane making guide.
